This Java program performs memory address translation using a page table approach, where virtual addresses are translated into physical addresses using a predefined page table. The algorithm reads a binary file, converts its contents into little endian binary strings, translates virtual addresses into physical addresses based on the page table, and writes the physical addresses to an output file.
